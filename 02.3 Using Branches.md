This document is an in-depth review of the `git branch` command and a discussion of the overall Git branching model. Branching is a feature available in most modern version control systems. Branching in other VCS's can be an expensive operation in both time and disk space. 

In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. This makes it harder for unstable code to get merged into the main code base, and it gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.

## 2.3.0 Commands
```bash=
git branch
git checkout
git merge
```

## [2.3.1 `git branch`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-branch-7d2ec18c6c5041a59ebbbe1641d15e0e)
A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.

The `git branch` command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the `git checkout` and `git merge` commands.

The implementation behind Git branches is much more lightweight than other version control system models. Instead of copying files from directory to directory, Git stores a branch as a reference to a commit. In this sense, a branch represents the tip of a series of commits—it's not a container for commits. The history for a branch is extrapolated through the commit relationships.

### Behind the scenes
Behind the scenes, in the repository's `./.git/objects` directory, Git stores all commits, local and remote. Git keeps remote and local branch commits distinctly separate through the use of branch refs. The refs for local branches are stored in the `./.git/refs/heads/`.

Remote branches are just like local branches, except they map to commits from somebody else’s repository. Remote branches are prefixed by the remote they belong to so that you don’t mix them up with local branches. Like local branches, Git also has refs for remote branches. Remote branch refs live in the `./.git/refs/remotes/` directory.

You can check out a remote branch just like a local one, but this puts you in a detached `HEAD` state (just like checking out an old commit). You can think of them as read-only branches.

## [2.3.2 `git checkout`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-checkout-a9768a8e5fa2430686e84387e431627b)
In Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The `git checkout` command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.

The `git checkout` command lets you navigate between the branches created by `git branch`. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch. Think of it as a way to select which line of development you’re working on.

## [2.3.3 `git merge`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-merge-38f812f8f7e347b790f24be166937bef)
合并是 Git 将被 fork 的历史放回到一起的方式。Git 有几种不同的算法来完成合并：快速向前合并或者三路合并。

### Fast-forward Merge and Three-way Merge
当当前分支顶端到目标分支路径是线性之时，我们可以采取 **快速向前合并** 。Git 只需要将当前分支顶端（快速向前地）移动到目标分支顶端，即可整合两个分支的历史，而不需要“真正”合并分支。它在效果上合并了历史，因为目标分支上的提交现在在当前分支可以访问到。

但是，如果分支已经分叉了，那么就无法进行快速向前合并。当和目标分支之间的路径不是线性之时，Git 只能执行 **三路合并** 。三路合并使用一个专门的提交来合并两个分支的历史。这个术语取自这样一个事实，Git 使用 *三个* 提交来生成合并提交：两个分支顶端和它们共同的祖先。

但你可以选择使用哪一种合并策略时，很多开发者喜欢使用快速向前合并（搭配 `rebase` 使用）来合并微小的功能或者修复 bug，使用三路合并来整合长期运行的功能。后者导致的合并提交作为两个分支的连接标志。

### 解决冲突
如果你尝试合并的两个分支同一个文件的同一个部分，Git 将无法决定使用哪个版本。当这种情况发生时，它会停在合并提交，让你手动解决这些冲突。

Git 的合并流程令人称赞的一点是，它使用我们熟悉的「编辑/缓存/提交」工作流来解决冲突。当你遇到合并冲突时，运行 `git status` 命令来查看哪些文件存在需要解决的冲突。比如，如果两个分支都修改了 `hello.py` 的同一处，你会看到下面的信息：

```bash
# On branch master
# Unmerged paths:
# (use "git add/rm ..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
#
# both modified: hello.py
#
```

When Git encounters a conflict during a merge, It will edit the content of the affected files with visual indicators that mark both sides of the conflicted content. These visual markers are: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. It's helpful to search a project for these indicators during a merge to find where conflicts need to be resolved.

```bash
here is some content not affected by the conflict
<<<<<<< main
this is conflicted text from main
=======
this is conflicted text from feature branch
>>>>>>> feature branch;
```

Generally the content before the `=======` marker is the receiving branch and the part after is the merging branch.

Once you've identified conflicting sections, you can go in and fix up the merge to your liking. When you're ready to finish the merge, all you have to do is run `git add` on the conflicted file(s) to tell Git they're resolved. Then, you run a normal `git commit` to generate the merge commit. It’s the exact same process as committing an ordinary snapshot, which means it’s easy for normal developers to manage their own merges.

Note that merge conflicts will only occur in the event of a 3-way merge. It’s not possible to have conflicting changes in a fast-forward merge.
