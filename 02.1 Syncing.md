The `git remote` command is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes. Records registered through the `git remote` command are used in conjunction with the `git fetch`, `git push`, and `git pull` commands. These commands all have their own syncing responsibilities which can be explored on the corresponding links.

## 2.1.0 Commands
```bash=
git remote
git fetch
git push
git pull
```

## [2.1.1 `git remote`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-remote-c1d43c0c1af04c0dacfe8afa289036ee)
The `git remote` command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

The `git remote` command is essentially an interface for managing a list of remote entries that are stored in the repository's `./.git/config` file. The `git remote` command is also a convenience or 'helper' method for modifying a repo's `./.git/config` file.

## [2.1.2 `git fetch`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-fetch-c5d63f6a10a748d5ac3839c5c2fa1a87)
The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the `git checkout` command. This makes fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with your local repository.

## [2.1.3 `git push`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-push-18b2414cf5d340ad843079c54114c123)
The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to `git fetch`, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.

### Pushing to bare repositories
A frequently used, modern Git practice is to have a remotely hosted `--bare` repository act as a central origin repository. Since pushing messes with the remote branch structure, It is safest and most common to push to repositories that have been created with the `--bare` flag. Bare repos don’t have a working directory so a push will not alter any in progress working directory content.

### Force Pushing
Git prevents you from overwriting the central repository’s history by refusing push requests when they result in a non-fast-forward merge. So, if the remote history has diverged from your history, you need to pull the remote branch and merge it into your local one, then try pushing again. 

The `--force` flag overrides this behavior and makes the remote repository’s branch match your local one, deleting any upstream changes that may have occurred since you last pulled. The only time you should ever need to force push is when you realize that the commits you just shared were not quite right and you fixed them with a `git commit --amend` or an interactive rebase. However, you must be absolutely certain that none of your teammates have pulled those commits before using the `--force` option.

Once a commit is amended a `git push` will fail because Git will see the amended commit and the remote commit as diverged content. The `--force` option must be used to push an amended commit.

```bash
# make changes to a repo and git add
git commit --amend
# update the existing commit message
git push --force origin main
```

The above example assumes it is being executed on an existing repository with a commit history. `git commit --amend` is used to update the previous commit. The amended commit is then force pushed using the `--force` option.

## [2.1.4 `git pull`](https://www.notion.so/leonax97stu/git-pull-632fc47bb0c842a8a6ad6e2f24be0709)
The `git pull` command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. The `git pull` command is actually a combination of two other commands, `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. In the first stage of operation `git pull` will execute a `git fetch` scoped to the local branch that `HEAD` is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, `git pull` will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and `HEAD` updated to point at the new commit.

### 基于 Rebase 的 Pull
`--rebase` 标记可以用来保证线性的项目历史，防止合并提交（merge commits）的产生。很多开发者倾向于使用 rebase 而不是 merge，因为「我想要把我的更改放在其他人完成的工作之后」。事实上，使用 `--rebase` 的 pull 的工作流是如此普遍，以致于你可以直接在配置项中设置它：

```bash
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
```

在运行这个命令之后，所有的 `git pull` 命令将使用 `git rebase` 而不是 `git merge`。

### `git fetch` vs `git pull`
When downloading content from a remote repo, `git pull` and `git fetch` commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider `git fetch` the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download the remote content but not update your local repo's working state, leaving your current work intact. `git pull` is the more aggressive alternative; it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute `git merge` to create a merge commit for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress this will cause conflicts and kick-off the merge conflict resolution flow.
