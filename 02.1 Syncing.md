The `git remote` command is one piece of the broader system which is responsible for syncing changes. Records registered through the `git remote` command are used in conjunction with the `git fetch`, `git push`, and `git pull` commands. These commands all have their own syncing responsibilities which can be explored on the corresponding links.

## 2.1.0 本节指令
```bash=
git remote
git fetch
git push
git pull
```

## 2.1.1 `git remote`
The `git remote` command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like bookmarks rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.

The `git remote` command is essentially an interface for managing a list of remote entries that are stored in the repository's `./.git/config` file. The `git remote` command is also a convenience or 'helper' method for modifying a repo's `./.git/config` file.

### Usage
```bash
$ git remote
origin
upstream
other_users_repo
```

By default, the `git remote` command will list previously stored remote connections to other repositories. This will produce single line output that lists the names of "bookmark" name of remote repos.

```bash
$ git remote -v
origin  git@bitbucket.com:origin_user/reponame.git (fetch)
origin  git@bitbucket.com:origin_user/reponame.git (push)
upstream    https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git (fetch)
upstream    https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git (push)
other_users_repo    https://bitbucket.com/other_users_repo/reponame (fetch)
other_users_repo    https://bitbucket.com/other_users_repo/reponame (push)
```

Invoking `git remote` with the `-v` option will print the list of bookmarked repository names and additionally, the corresponding repository URL. The `-v` option stands for "verbose". Below is example output of verbose `git remote` output.

```bash
git remote add <name> <url>
```

Adds a record to `./.git/config` for remote named `＜name＞` at the repository url `＜url＞.`

- Accepts a `-f` option, that will `git fetch` immediately after the remote record is created.
- Accepts a `--tags` option, that will `git fetch` immediately and import every tag from the remote repository.

```bash
git remote rename <old_name> <new_name>
```

Updates `./.git/config` to rename the record `＜old_name＞` to `＜new_name＞`. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are updated.

```bash
git remote rm <name>
```

Modifies `./.git/config` and removes the remote named `＜name＞`. All remote-tracking branches and configuration settings for the remote are removed.

```bash
git remote get-url <name>
```

Outputs the URLs for a remote record.
- Accepts `--push`, push URLs are queried rather than fetch URLs.
- With `--all`, all URLs for the remote will be listed.

```bash
$ git remote show <name>
* remote upstream
   Fetch URL: https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git
   Push URL: https://bitbucket.com/upstream_user/reponame.git
   HEAD branch: main
   Remote branches:
      main tracked
      simd-deprecated tracked
      tutorial tracked
   Local ref configured for 'git push':
      main pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```
Outputs high-level information about the remote `＜name＞`. This output will contain a list of branches associated with the remote and also the endpoints attached for fetching and pushing.

```bash
git remote prune <name>
```

Deletes any local branches for `＜name＞` that are not present on the remote repository.

- Accepts a `--dry-run` option which will list what branches are set to be pruned, but will not actually prune them.

## 2.1.2 `git fetch`
The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the `git checkout` command. This makes fetching a safe way to review commits before integrating them with your local repository.

### 用法
```bash
git fetch <remote>
```

Fetch all of the branches from the repository. This also downloads all of the required commits and files from the other repository.

```bash
git fetch <remote> <branch>
```

Same as the above command, but only fetch the specified branch.

```bash
git fetch --all
```

A power move which fetches all registered remotes and their branches:

```bash
git fetch --dry-run
```

The `--dry-run` option will perform a demo run of the command. It will output examples of actions it will take during the fetch but not apply them.


### Typical Workflow to Sync with Remote Repos
```bash
$ git fetch origin
a1e8fb5..45e66a4 main -> origin/main
a1e8fb5..9e8ab1c develop -> origin/develop
* [new branch] some-feature -> origin/some-feature
```

在下图中，远程分支中的提交显示为方块，而不是圆圈。正如你所见，`git fetch` 让你看到了另一个仓库完整的分支结构。

![Git Tutorial: git fetch](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:0718ae20-0dc5-482c-a38c-25e4f1a1a3b0/02.svg)
若想查看添加到上游 main 上的提交，你可以运行 `git log`，用 `origin/main` 过滤：

```bash
git log --oneline main..origin/main
```

用下面这些命令接受更改并并入你的本地 `main` 分支：

```bash
git checkout main
git merge origin/main
```

`origin/main` 和 `main` 分支现在指向了同一个提交，你已经和上游的更新保持了同步。

## 2.1.3 `git push`
The `git push` command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to `git fetch`, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing. These issues are discussed below.

### 用法
```bash
git push <remote> <branch>
```
将指定的分支推送到 `<remote>` 上，包括所有需要的提交和提交对象。它会在目标仓库中创建一个本地分支。为了防止你覆盖已有的提交，如果会导致目标仓库非快速向前合并时，Git 不允许你 push。

```bash
git push <remote> --force
```

和上一个命令相同，但即使会导致非快速向前合并也强制推送。除非你确定你所做的事，否则不要使用 `--force` 标记。

```bash
git push <remote> --all
```

将所有本地分支推送到指定的远程仓库。

```bash
git push <remote> --tags
```

当你推送一个分支或是使用 `--all` 选项时，标签不会被自动推送上去。`--tags` 将你所有的本地标签推送到远程仓库中去。

### Pushing to bare repositories
A frequently used, modern Git practice is to have a remotely hosted `--bare` repository act as a central origin repository. Since pushing messes with the remote branch structure, It is safest and most common to push to repositories that have been created with the `--bare` flag. Bare repos don’t have a working directory so a push will not alter any in progress working directory content.

### Force Pushing
Git prevents you from overwriting the central repository’s history by refusing push requests when they result in a non-fast-forward merge. So, if the remote history has diverged from your history, you need to pull the remote branch and merge it into your local one, then try pushing again. 

The `--force` flag overrides this behavior and makes the remote repository’s branch match your local one, deleting any upstream changes that may have occurred since you last pulled. The only time you should ever need to force push is when you realize that the commits you just shared were not quite right and you fixed them with a `git commit --amend` or an interactive rebase. However, you must be absolutely certain that none of your teammates have pulled those commits before using the `--force` option.

Once a commit is amended a `git push` will fail because Git will see the amended commit and the remote commit as diverged content. The `--force` option must be used to push an amended commit.

```bash
# make changes to a repo and git add
git commit --amend
# update the existing commit message
git push --force origin main
```

The above example assumes it is being executed on an existing repository with a commit history. `git commit --amend` is used to update the previous commit. The amended commit is then force pushed using the `--force` option.

### Deleting a remote branch or tag
Sometimes branches need to be cleaned up for book keeping or organizational purposes. The fully delete a branch, it must be deleted locally and also remotely.

```bash
git branch -D branch_name
git push origin :branch_name
```

The above will delete the remote branch named branch_name passing a branch name prefixed with a colon to `git push` will delete the remote branch.

## 2.1.4 `git pull`
The `git pull` command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows. The `git pull` command is actually a combination of two other commands, `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. In the first stage of operation `git pull` will execute a `git fetch` scoped to the local branch that `HEAD` is pointed at. Once the content is downloaded, `git pull` will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be-created and `HEAD` updated to point at the new commit.

### 用法
```bash
git pull <remote>
```

拉取当前分支对应的远程副本中的更改，并立即并入本地副本。效果和 `git fetch` 后接 `git merge origin/.` 一致。

```bash
git pull --rebase <remote>
```

和上一个命令相同，但使用 `git rebase` 合并远程分支和本地分支，而不是使用 `git merge`。

### 基于 Rebase 的 Pull
`--rebase` 标记可以用来保证线性的项目历史，防止合并提交（merge commits）的产生。很多开发者倾向于使用 rebase 而不是 merge，因为「我想要把我的更改放在其他人完成的工作之后」。事实上，使用 `--rebase` 的 pull 的工作流是如此普遍，以致于你可以直接在配置项中设置它：

```bash
git config --global branch.autosetuprebase always
```

在运行这个命令之后，所有的 `git pull` 命令将使用 `git rebase` 而不是 `git merge`。

### `git fetch` vs `git pull`
When downloading content from a remote repo, `git pull` and `git fetch` commands are available to accomplish the task. You can consider `git fetch` the 'safe' version of the two commands. It will download the remote content but not update your local repo's working state, leaving your current work intact. `git pull` is the more aggressive alternative; it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute `git merge` to create a merge commit for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress this will cause conflicts and kick-off the merge conflict resolution flow.
